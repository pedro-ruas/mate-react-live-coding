# Mate Academy React test

This repository contains a very basic implementation for a React app connected to the Poke API.

Home Page:

1. For now, it displays a fixed pokemon image and lists the name for all pokemons, but the image doesn't match the name.

2. The objective of the task is to make it so that by switching the pokemon name, the image will also change.

3. Each pokemon should be displayed in a simple card with minimal info, and use the corresponding type background.

4. The pokemon display should be located in the correct place in the Pokedéx. Image is available in assets.

-----------

See All Page:

1. A list with all pokemon should be displayed in a grid below the input fields. Mobile grid: 2 columns, Tablet grid: 3 columns, Others: 4 columns.

2. User should be able to filter pokemons by type, default is ALL (no filter).

3. User should be able to search by a pokemon name

-----------

- For this present taks, sorting, searching and filtering can be performed in the front-end only
- "Pages" can also be treated like Tabs on a single page 

- PókeAPI Docs is accessible here:[API](https://pokeapi.co/)
